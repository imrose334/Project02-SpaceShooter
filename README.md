Project for MSCH-C220
27 September 2025

A user-controlled ship for a space-shooter game. Created in Unity.

## Implementation

Suggestion : 19-20 points
FEATURES I ADDED: 

1. Asteroid collision with player and enemy (1 point)
2. Added a background image (1 point)
3. Created 3 seperate levels for a total of 4 levels (1 point)
4. Downloaded and used assets from the internet (spliced gif into spritesheet) (1 point)

5. Calculated Score needed to advance to next level, with a final Win scene (~1 point)
6. Animated background image (~1 point)
7. Made it so that when Asteroids collide with themselves your score increases (~1 point)
